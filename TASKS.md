# Draft 2019-09 Scope

-   [âœ“] `getSchema` inconsistent return of non-node for root-requests
-   [ ] introduction of scopes reduces jlib performance by ~20-22%. can we do sth about this?
    -   moving this logic to draft 2019 would solve this, but introduce two different apis unless we can hide it
    -   a consistent api might lead to performance impacts of legacy drafts
    -   an inconsistent api would not be manageable (duplicate utils like getTemplate etc)
    -   there is probably a lot that can be improved (also in compile time)
-   [ ] add all subSchemas to scope-history as only if and anyOf are tested
-   [ ] decision on supported draft 2019-09 format-options

# Tasks
