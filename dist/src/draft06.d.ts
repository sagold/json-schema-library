 * - propertyNames
 * - contains
 * - const
 * - format: uri-reference
 * - format: uri-template

 * - $id replaces id
 * - $ref only allowed where a schema is expected
 * - "exclusiveMinimum" and exclusiveMaximum changed from a boolean to a number to be consistent with the principle of keyword independence
