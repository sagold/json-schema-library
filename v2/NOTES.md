-   do not use reduce in validation, this messes up recursive resolution
-   since we currently do not use get in validation, spec does not test this. This also means we have duplicate logic for the same functionality
-   all functionality is (probably) based on:
    -- validate
    -- reduce (uses validate)
    -- getTemplate (uses reduce)
    -- getSchema (uses validate and reduce) and
    -- the node-tree
